////  Installation Instructions  ////
/////////////////////////////////////

1)  Exit Maya

2)  Navigate to your local "My Documents" Maya directory, which should look something like:   C:\Users\Dennis\Documents\maya\2018\prefs
		The number in this directory path will reflect which version of Maya you are using.  It may be 2013-x64, 2016.5, 2017LT, etc.

2a) If you are updating from Material Manager 4, first delete all related files to that version.

3)  From the ZIP file, extract the MaterialManager directory into the   \maya\2018\prefs\icons   directory

4)  From the ZIP file, extract dp_materialManager.mel, mm_config.txt, and mm_material_presets.txt into the   \maya\2018\prefs\scripts   directory.
		Note that the scripts directory in this step refers to the one inside the PREFS folder.  There is another scripts directory under
		the folder labeled with your version of Maya (maya\2018\scripts): if you install here, the script will not work properly.

5)  Open Maya

6)  In the Script Editor or MEL command line, copy and paste the following line below:

		source dp_materialManager.mel;  materialManager;
